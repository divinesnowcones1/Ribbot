1) Obtain accurate dimensions and weights of robot components

2) Model the leg as spring torque vs time

3) Manual iteration of spine starting angle, torque, and start time
	Torque/Start Time: input vector
	Spine Starting Angle: Spine subsystem, Spine Joint, State Targets, Specify Position Target, Value

4) Optimization
	1) Dynamic equations of robot
	2) Collocation of dynamic equations
	3) Objective functions and implementation with fmincon and simulation

5) Reference tracker for spine control
